Dataset Used
● IAM dataset download from here (Only lines.txt Required)

In Order to use this project : Download all codes provided as code_files in the
drive link and upload the same in your local editor(VS Code preferably).
NOTE : We have trained this model on the dataset provided .
To run our model(Given you have installed all the requirements
beforehand) :
      1) Activate the virtual environment with Tensorflow.(Follow this link in order to
      install and activate tensorflow : https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
      2) Move to cd Downloads(or directory where you have downloaded the code folder).
      3) Now to main folder where source code available : cd code_files/src
      4) And run :
      $ python main.py
      5) To Run in Web with Flask(as we have deployed this Deep learning model with
      flask ):
Run : $ python upload.py
      ● Certain commands on the terminal will be popped out where your
      web will be activated on your local host .
      ● Copy that url and paste/open the same in the browser.
      
      Select any sample image from the “cd downloads/HTR/data” folder.
      (I have provided some sample images for your test).
